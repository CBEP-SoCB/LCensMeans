Description: This tiny package exposes a couple of functions for estimating the
    conditional mean of censored values for left censored environmental data. It
    is still common practice in envrionemtnal data analysis to replace
    "non-detects" in envrionmental data with essentially arbitrary values, 
    usually  0, one half of the detection limit or the detection limit.  None of
    these approaches rests on any statistical foundation, and they ignore the
    information available from knowing that a sample concetration was
    below a certain value. The goal of this package is to replace non-detects
    with a maximum likelihood-derived estimator of the mean of the unobserved 
    (censored) observations.  It estimates those means by calculating maximum
    likelihood estimates of parameters of a log normal distribution that could
    have produced the observed censored data, and then simulating a draw from
    that distribution, and calculating an average of values that would have been
    censored.
