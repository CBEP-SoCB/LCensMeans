Description: This tiny package exposes functions for estimating the
    conditional mean of censored values for left censored environmental data. It
    is still common practice in envrionmental data analysis to replace
    "non-detects" with essentially arbitrary values, 
    usually 0, one half of the detection limit, or the detection limit.  None of
    these approaches rests on any statistical foundation, and they ignore the
    information available from knowing that a sample concentration was
    below a certain value. The goal of this package is to replace non-detects
    with a maximum likelihood-derived estimator of the mean of the unobserved 
    (censored) observations.  It estimates those means by calculating maximum
    likelihood estimates of parameters of a log normal distribution that could
    have produced the observed censored data, simulating a draw from
    that distribution, and calculating an average of values that would have been
    censored.
